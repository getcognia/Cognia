/**
 * Seeds the "Project Polaris handover" demo cluster into the Blit Labs

 * feature called Polaris, then left the company. A new engineer (Alex)
 * joined and has to ship in one week. The context is scattered across
 * Slack, Notion, Google Docs, GitHub, Linear, Gmail, and Loom.
 *
 * Idempotent — re-running deletes only the Polaris memories (matched by
 * page_metadata.polaris === true) before re-inserting.
 *
 * Prerequisite: a `blit-labs` Organization with users alex/sarah/bob
 * @blitlabs.com must already exist.

 * Usage:

      "Day 1 notes. **What I think Polaris is**: realtime co-editing for canvas v3, built on Y.js + WebSockets, currently in beta with 3 customers, committed to ACME for GA in 4 weeks. **What I'm unclear on**: (1) what's actually broken vs. what's in flight? (2) the sharding work — is it done? Sarah's handoff says '60%', Bob's last update also says '60%' but mentions Redis pub/sub flakiness in staging — is that a separate issue? (3) POLARIS-23 — there's no decision and apparently a meeting happened but no notes. (4) the selection-flicker fix is on a branch that 'fails on Safari' — what does that mean? (5) what does ACME actually need for GA vs. nice-to-have? **Action items**: pull Bob's Notion before it's deleted, watch the Loom, read crdt/awareness.ts.",

      "Alex → Jordan (DM): hey — quick one. for Polaris GA on May 30, what's the must-have list? I'm seeing references to a sharding fix (>700 users) and an offline-edge-case (POLARIS-23) but it's unclear which are GA-blocking vs post-GA. Jordan: ACME is the anchor. Their must-haves are: (1) selection-flicker fixed, (2) handle their all-hands of ~600 users without errors, (3) no data loss on offline edits. (1) is straightforward, (2) is the sharding work, (3) is POLARIS-23. ALL THREE are GA-blocking. We can de-scope the cross-shard awareness optimization — single-shard at 700 users is fine for ACME's specific use. Alex: 🙏",
